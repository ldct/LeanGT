The proposed definition is
N_H(A) := { h ∈ H | hAh⁻¹ = A }
this has type `Set H`. It's probably better to define it as
N_H(A) := { h ∈ G | h ∈ H, hAh⁻¹ = A }
now it has type `Set H` and the statement is obvious

  sorry

-- 10 informal proof: if g fixes H then it sends 1 to 1 and g to g so it centralizes H
